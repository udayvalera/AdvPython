You are working as a data scientist for a healthcare organization, and your team has been tasked with analysing COVID-19 data from multiple countries. The data is stored in JSON files, with each file representing the daily COVID-19 statistics for a specific country. Each JSON file has the following structure:

    {"country":"Country Name",
    "Date":"YYYY-MM-DD",
    "Confirmed_Cases":{"Total":1000,"New":50},
    "Deaths":{"Total":20,"New":2},
    "Recovered":{"Total":800,"New":30}
    }

Your task is to write a Python program that performs the following operations:

    1. Read COVID-19 data from all JSON files in a given directory and its sub-directories.
    2. Calculate and display the following statistics for each country:
        1. Total Confirmed Cases.
        2. Total Deaths.
        3. Total Recovered Cases.
        4. Total Active Cases.
    3. Determine the top 5 countries with the highest number of confirmed cases and the lowest number of confirmed cases.
    4. Generate a summary report in JSON format that includes the statistics for all countries and save it to a file named 'covid19_summary.json'.
